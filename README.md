# Reflection
## Create Repository
### You go to your profile, repositories, new, enter the information, then click Create Repository
## Add, Push, Pull
### Using git commands in your remote repository, you enter `git add .` into the terminal to add the current directory to the commit
### To push you first need to commit using `git commit -m "some description"` then `git push origin master` 
### To pull you need to fetch using `git pull origin master`
## Branching
### Branching is when you create a new copy from the original code, and add some changes to not break the active branch. This allows for people to work on small features while not break other features if something happens like an error. When you're done you merge it with the active code, fix errors that may occur then finally merge it in.
